# XRayAnalyzer 🩺

> An AI-powered tool using Deep Learning to **detect and localize suspicious areas** in chest radiographs.

This repository contains the code for **XRayAnalyzer**, a project designed to assist in medical diagnosis by **detecting and localizing potential anomalies** in chest X-rays.

The primary goal is to **identify suspicious areas (e.g., nodules, opacities, or other pathologies)** that may require further medical review. This project is part of my M.Sc. in Computer Science at the University of Parma.
